        Used in DarkHistory. Assumes a homogeneous universe.
        If injection cannot be thought of as events, use 1 injection per second by convention.
        This factor is kept for DarkHistory's API, but will cancel out in the final result.

        Args:
            z_start (float): Starting redshift of the redshift step of injection.
            z_end (float, optional): Ending redshift of the redshift step of injection.
                Useful for calculating the average rate over a redshift step when injection rate evolves quickly.
                If None, must return instantaneous rate. This is used in DarkHistory's TLA integrator.
                For slow varying rates, it is sufficient to return the rate at the starting redshift for Euler steppping.
            state (dict, optional): State of the universe at z_start. Used for rates with feedback.
